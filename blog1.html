<p><h4>9/5/13-</h4> Lived Experience Paper: For the first paper, we had to talk about a major that we wanted to pursue and then identify a piece of technology that was related to that field and talk about how they are related. I chose to talk about a commercial, specifically an ASPCA commercial and how it was related to veterinary medicine, my planned career.</p>

<p><h4>9/12/13-</h4>  In Class Activity 1: The purpose of the video was to show that there are people that care about you whether you know it or not and suicide is never the answer no matter how bad things are because there are people that support you- things will get better even though there may seem like no other way out at the time. The video attempts to achieve its purpose by having the author of the letter, who has a first-hand experience to the situation, talk on screen which adds emotion to the video and kind of makes the audience feel bad, think and listen more. The structure of the message was effective because the author didn’t come right out and tell the audience that his uncle committed suicide. He talks more about his personal experience in his mother’s face when she talked about him and how he is gay throughout the whole thing while making the video sound like a personal story instead of a letter being read out loud. The structure of this video can help to write the Lived Experience project since it did a good job of creating a personal experience and didn’t make it sound like a writing. The video sounded like it was coming from the author just telling a story and didn’t sound like he had written it before and was reading it out loud to the audience.</p>

<p><h4>9/19/13- </h4> Lived Experience Final: After having my paper revised, I needed to expand on my explanations of how the commercial is related to veterinary medicine and why I chose that field. I also have a problem with run on sentences so fixing those throughout the paper was important. On this paper, I got a 3.0. While this is not exactly to my standards, it was my first college essay and I hopefully can improve as the semester goes on.</p>

<p><h4>10/3/13-</h4>  Cultural Analysis Draft: For the second paper we wrote, we had to pick a social issue and find an artifact such as a music video, movie, etc. that portrays that social issue. I chose to use the music video by Macklemore of “Same Love” and talk about gay rights as a social issue. </p>

<p><h4>10/10/13-</h4>  In Class Activity 2: There is a positive correlation between formal education and economic and personal success. If someone has a higher level of education, they are more likely to be successful and therefore have more economic success. The same applies in a negative way; if someone has a low level of education, the probability of him or her having a high pay and is low. While there are always exceptions, the majority of human beings will not have economic success in today’s economy unless they are willing to put in the work to succeed in the educational aspect of life. Some people are able to get away with a lower level of education and still have high financial such as professional athletes or lottery winners and likewise, there are people who put in effort to have a high level education but still do not necessarily have the economic success that they may like if there are not jobs available in their field.  </p>

<p><h4>10/11/13- </h4> Social Networking Movie: Watching the Social Network in class I thought was obviously fun. I have seen the movie once before but never really noticed it. This time watching it, I realized the lack of respect that the original idea of Facebook had on women. The original idea was to post pictures of girls and allow people to say whether they are “pretty” or “ugly.” I don’t think it is right for college guys to be able to decide that, especially on a social media site for everyone to see. Honestly, many college students have not fully matured and allowing drunken boys to go online and talk about a girl is disrespectful and completely irrational. Facebook has obviously come a long way but its interesting to see how todays website got its idea from something like that. </p>

<p><h4>10/17/13- </h4> Cultural Analysis Final: Since this paper had a length of 1,800-2,000 words, after turning in my draft and having it revised, I realized I needed to expand on my analysis. To do so, I added more explanation as to how the music video was portraying the social issue of gay rights. I also went online and did more research to show how big of an issue gay rights is in the United States to add length and credibility to the statements I was making about the issue.</p>

<p><h4>10/24/13- </h4> Formal Research Draft: The Formal Research paper was the most time consuming paper as well as the most difficult for me. With this paper, we had to find two articles, one scholarly and one trade, to analyze and relate back to a major that we were giving information about. I chose veterinary medicine, like for the first paper. We also had to conduct two interviews for this paper, one with someone who practices this profession and one with somebody who teaches it. The last part of this paper was to analyze the economic aspect that this profession provides. </p>

<p><h4>11/7/13- </h4> Extra-Terrestrial Documentary: I thought this documentary was kind of interesting. It was cool to see what types of medical procedures were done throughout the ancient societies. I also enjoyed seeing the science behind the thoughts that there were extra-terrestrial beings behind the high level knowledge of the procedures that were being done. I do not believe that there are aliens that were guiding these ancient Egyptians but I can see how people would believe there was something else going on. It is mind-blowing that someone would be able to perform the surgeries without the technology and research that we have today.</p> 

<p><h4>11/11/13- </h4> In Class Activity 3: The imagery of Detroit that was used was the ones specific to Detroit that show its originality such as the Fox Theatre and the man made ice rink every winter to create a positive image of the city instead of showing the areas that are worn down that may create a less than positive picture to the viewers. By using the song “Lose Yourself” by Eminem, the advertisement had a sort of intimidating background music that would make the car seem that much better. Also, the song is about not letting a moment go and the producers are creating the illusion that this car is available now and if you let it go, you’re not going to get it. The voiceover of the advertisement is talking about a city that has not always been the best. Over the years, Detroit has been known as a city with a lot of crimes and has not necessarily been highly respected. The voiceover is talking about the fact that going through tough times makes a city better and Chrysler is like that too. They have gone through a tough time at one point or another and therefore have the better product. Also by relating to a city that has not always been on the top, the company looks like they are relating to everyone and not only the ‘top’ people in the country. </p>


<p><h4>11/12/13-</h4>  Chrysler Commercial: I never really look at the details as to why people use certain music or visuals when creating a commercial but with the assignment on the Chrysler commercial, I watched it multiple times to try and analyze it. Being from Michigan, I hear a lot about Detroit and I know it is not the best place to be now a days. I thought the Chrysler commercial did a really good job of portraying the positives of Detroit and making it look good since all that people see it as is a bad city. By using the Eminem song “Lose Yourself,” it shows that we shouldn’t give up on the city of Detroit. The song talks about not giving up, and even though the city has been going down hill, there are positives and starting with those, the city can be turned around and become what it once was. </p>


<p><h4>11/14/13- </h4> Remix Documentary: The group portion of the Multimodal remix project was a documentary on one of the three papers that had been written throughout the semester. My group decided to base the video off the cultural analysis and base the documentary on the overuse of technology by teenagers. We used various clips of people using their phones as well as a news broadcast and a few interviews of people who use or don’t use technology to see the different amounts. </p>

<p><h4>11/21/13- </h4> Final Retrospective Draft: This final paper was meant to reflect on all of the papers throughout the semester and critically analyze the writing pieces. It was also used to put together the class website. When I originally wrote the draft, I wrote a paper on what each paper required and I gave tips on how to be successful while writing them- I didn’t talk about my specific papers. After I looked at other student’s papers and re-read the assignment, I kept some of the tips on how to be successful and some of the information on what the paper was about, but I talked more about my papers and what I wrote and how I could fix it. It was helpful seeing the other student’s papers to see how they laid out the paper and how they went about it.</p> 

<p><h4>11/30/13- </h4> Codecademy: I have a love/hate relationship with the codecademy. I thought it was very lengthy and it look me a long time to complete even with doing a little at a time. I also thought that there was a lot of repetition and that was annoying to me. What was cool about it was all of the things that it showed me how to do. I have absolutely no knowledge of how to put a website together or what the codes mean so I did think all of that was helpful to putting my portfolio together.</p> 

<p><h4>12/5/13-</h4>  Course Overview: Throughout the course, I had a constant feeling that I was not doing something. I think that was because the class was very unorganized in the set up and I think that not knowing my grade the entire semester was contributing to that as well.  Overall however, I did learn a bunch of different styles of writing that I will be helpful throughout my college career. </p>
