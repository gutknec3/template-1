	<h1>Final Retrospective</h1>
		
<p> Coming into college and being told you must take a writing class is not always the most enticing thing to hear, especially when the major you intend to pursue has nothing to do with writing. Many times, when there is a class that is not interesting, the student doesn’t do as well as if they were really interested in the subject. However, there are some simple things to do in order to be successful in the WRA science and technology class, as well as many other classes. Being organized is something that will not only help with this class, but in here it is especially important. Since the class only meets once a week, it is easy to get behind. Make sure to check schedule updates and due dates multiple times throughout the week leading up to class. There are times when certain assignments will not have the same due date as they were initially assigned because a class gets cancelled, the students need more time, and so on. Staying on top of things is another very important thing for this class. The assignments such as codecademy, the website, and the readings are not checked in on a weekly basis but will still play a major part in the grade at the end. The schedule is put together with the codecademy and reading assignments for a reason. Also, by staying on top of everything throughout the semester can save last minute questions on how to do things when you are rushing to get everything done in the last week. No matter how good of a writer you are, it is always smart to get someone else’s opinion on your writing before turning it in.  It is always possible that someone else has an idea of how to improve the writing whether it is a teacher or just a friend. There is also always the option to send the paper to the professor before the due date and ask her to help with editing layout and flow of the paper.  Throughout the course, it didn’t seem like I was learning anything. However, when I look back on it, each paper taught me something different. Through each paper, I was able to see a different style of writing and I was introduced to researching papers and applying them to my writing, which I wasn’t necessarily familiar with before. I was also able to learn how to make a website and learn a bit more about the codes and work that goes into making websites and that is something I knew nothing about before. Even though I am not pursing a career that has to write a lot of essays, these different tactics to writing will help me throughout college and still in my career. </p>

<p> Being the first writing assignment, the Lived Experience paper is not as demanding as the others but is still just as important. Since the paper is based on the individuals intended major, it is easier to relate to. On my paper, I wrote about my choice to pursue a major in veterinary medicine and how the technology of a television commercial was the reasoning behind picking this major. I talked about one ASPCA commercial in specific that was very convincing for my career choice. I also looked into the different careers that could be chosen for veterinary medicine including being a veterinary technician and what that would consist of as a career. I went into details of their job description and talked about how I didn’t want to do that and instead definitely wanted to be a veterinarian. Since there are a few different types of vets, I went over the difference between the specialties and what the difference was between them. I feel I could have improved this paper by making it more of a personal story instead of a paper filled with lots of information. I researched different specialties within the field of veterinary medicine, which made the paper sound more of an essay and research paper than the personal narrative that it should have been.</p> 

<p> When you get to the Cultural Analysis paper, picking a social issue and a related artifact may be difficult. The key to being able to pick one that you can write about is to not necessarily try to be original but instead pick an issue that you can find a lot of information on to help put the paper together. Finding as much information as possible on the social issue before you begin writing is helpful because then you will be able to base your outline on the information you find instead of having to research once you start writing. For my cultural analysis paper, I talked about the social issue of gay marriage. I used the music video of the song “Same Love,” by Macklemore as my artifact that relates to the social issue. I analyzed the artifact and talked about how the music video portrays a gay boy who feels lost in society because being gay is not accepted. I researched the disadvantages that gay couples have compared to a straight couple and talked about how these differences were unfair. There are fourteen states out of the fifty that have legalized gay marriage but there are still differences in the way those couples are treated amongst those states and I brought in stats to show this. My conclusion talked about a way to help change this social issue and that was to legalize gay marriage in all states. The argument that I made as to why this would help was because it would be more socially acceptable around the country and that way gay couples aren’t as much of a minority as they are now. I could have improved this essay by making my paragraphs more about one specific thing to make the point stick instead of bringing in multiple facts and only talking about each one in a sentence or two. The analysis of the music video could have been improved by talking more about how the video portrays a positive outlook on gay couples.</p>

<p> The Formal Research paper is the most demanding when it comes to the amount of work that is needed to put the paper together. For this paper, it is super important to start ahead since it has so much work to do regarding interviews and research of articles. When searching for visuals, be sure that they relate to the discipline and support the paper well while not being too confusing. The visual should not depend on an explanation in order to be deciphered.  My formal research paper was again based on animal science and veterinary medicine.  I went through various different ways to order the paper but ended up talking about the writing, reading, and research that is required and using the interviews and articles to add into those paragraphs and back up my points. Luckily, I know a veterinarian and was able to reach out to her as one of my interviewees and I used my advisor as another one. Finding articles was the most difficult part for me. Since there isn’t a lot of information about the specific reading, writing, and research in veterinary medicine, it took a long time to find two articles that could be used to back up my information. I feel like I could have improved the overall paper by being less repetitive. I think since there was a word length requirement that needed to be met, I forced some information into the paper that may not have been needed. I also think I could have done better interview questions or a follow up to get more information to make up for the limited articles that are available for veterinary medicine.</p> 

<p> With the remix project, having a plan before beginning to video is important. That is where my group went wrong. Originally we had decided we were going to use the cultural analysis paper and make a documentary on the over use of technology. We talked about what we wanted to do and portray when we made the documentary but we never figure out a way to make it happen. The only thing we went over was that we needed clips of people using their phones. While we did need this, we needed other things too. Having all four of the people in our group getting clips of people using their phones wouldn’t exactly make a good documentary. Over break I decided to interview someone who uses a lot of technology and someone who uses none to show the difference in lifestyles. I also went onto YouTube and found a news story on the over use of technology to make a stronger point. Once we got all of the interviews, clips, and videos together, we added some text and background music. With the limited knowledge on how to make a documentary, I felt the video turned out well but we definitely could have improved it. The biggest problem we had was not making a plan and having everyone in the group go do the same thing on our own. I think the communication within our group was the biggest mistake that we made and if we had to do it over, I definitely would plan and communicate better at the beginning.</p> 

<p> As my first writing class in college, I felt there was a lot I could have improved on but I also think I did well and learned a many different aspects to writing a paper. In high school I was taught the basic five-paragraph paper that I stuck to for basically any assignment. After this class, I know that is not always the best way to go about writing a paper. I got experience researching articles and was then able to use them in my papers to make a stronger point. The lived experience paper made me learn to write a personal paper instead of always making an essay sound so formal. Cultural analysis allowed me to relate some type of technology to a major social issue as well as finding information on the Internet. With the formal research paper, I was able to put the knowledge of research, interviews, and writing together. Outside of the writing, I learned how to make a website and became much more familiar with the codes used. Sometimes I may have been overwhelmed and felt very unorganized and lose, but I think this class was a good introduction to the various writing pieces that I will need to do throughout my college career.</p>
