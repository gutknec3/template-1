		<p>When I was younger I had a routine that included watching TV every day when I came home from school. Throughout the hours of cartoons and Full House that were watched, I had gotten to see my fair share of commercials. One specific commercial influenced my choice of majors for today. The ASPCA and animal abuse commercials, which encouraged people to donate money to help provide vaccinations, food, and shelter for these helpless animals always made me upset.  With an already existent love of animals, as I grew up and continued to see these commercials, I realized that I wanted to be able to help these animals leading me to become a pre-vet major.</p>
<p>TV commercials air for a total of roughly twenty minutes out of an hour-long show on television, and each commercial traditionally runs for no more than two minutes. For everyone, certain commercials stand out to him or her whether it is because they are funny, because they promote something the viewer is interested in, or because it is sensitive and makes the viewer think. This was the case with the ASPCA commercials for me.  In a specific ASPCA commercial with Sarah McLachlan, there was a dog that was unable to walk with its hind legs that caused him to collapse with every step he tried to take. This really stood out to me because seeing an animal struggle is heartbreaking enough and knowing that the animals can’t let people know what is hurting him makes it even more difficult to watch. After that commercial, I definitely knew veterinary medicine was my calling. Seeing animals caged in and unable to run around like they are supposed to makes my heart break. The look in their eyes is so helpless and knowing they can’t do anything to make themselves better makes me want to do something and change their life. I have four animals myself and I know that no matter what, I would do anything to keep them safe and happy. Animals are not capable of preparing their own meals, they are unable to open doors to let themselves go outside to go to the bathroom, they are confined to the small areas within the house they live in and most importantly, animals can’t tell someone when they don’t feel good or they need help.</p>
<p>After seeing the commercials, I decided to look more into the possibility of pursuing a career in veterinary medicine. I went online and looked into what being a vet required, how long it would take to become one, and what other possibilities there were. What I found was that a pre-vet major isn’t limited to pursuing a career at a veterinarian. There is also a possibility to become a vet technician, who still is able to work with the animals and be in the office with the veterinarian, but they are like the nurses in a hospital.  Becoming a vet-tech is also two less years of veterinary school than if I wanted to become a veterinarian. The job of a veterinary technician varies from state to state depending on the laws regarding what they are allowed to do. Typically, vet technicians take blood and urinary samples, tissue for testing, take x-rays, prepare animals for surgery, administer medications and make sure the examination room is ready for a new patient. Veterinary technicians are around to assist the veterinarian and make sure the animals are comfortable while being treated.</p>
<p>By the time I was done doing research, I had decided that I wanted to work with the animals more than a veterinary technician would and decided that I was definitely going to become a vet. Through my research, I realized that having the job of a veterinarian is like a doctor with the exception of not being able to communicate with their patients. I would have to figure out the problem for myself or by talking with the owners instead of being able to ask the patient. Vets are required to treat animals when they are sick, give them physical examinations to make sure they are healthy, give advice to owners, and even perform surgery on an animal if it is necessary. There are four different types of veterinarians and each one specializes in a different area of the field. There is a companion vet that works with the traditional household pets such as cats and dogs, an equine veterinarian that works specifically with horses, livestock vets that work more with farm animals such as cows, sheep, and pigs, and then there is a research vet who works in the labs. A research veterinarian would look at health problems and experiment with different procedures to improve animal’s health and communicate this to the veterinarians who work with the animals to get the best medications and treatment to the animals.  Before I started researching the different possibilities in the veterinary field, I knew that I did not want to be working in a lab becoming a research veterinarian was out of the question. Even though I still have not completely decided which type of animals I want to work with, I have eliminated being a livestock veterinarian and am now deciding between a companion vet and an equine vet.</p>
<p>I have owned animals since I was in first grade and ever since then I have helped take care of them. From a young age I was introduced to the responsibilities of owning an animal’s so I know that it is not always the easiest task. Just like having kids, it’s a personal choice to own an animal. If someone wants to take on the responsibility of owning a pet, they must commit to helping the animal survive and providing it a loving environment to live in since that is basically the only place they will ever know. While owning an animal may come with a lot of work and money, the love an animal returns is something that cannot be replaced. There are days when I have been sick and the first one by my side is my dog and she is giving me a kiss. While there are days that her barking, or one of my cats meowing is the most annoying thing in the world, I wouldn’t trade them for the world. Unfortunately, not everyone cares enough to take care of their pets in the way that they should. Some animals are abused by their owners and cannot fend for themselves to survive. As a veterinarian, I would have the opportunity to save animals that have been abused in the attempt to change their lives and help get them into a home that they will be happy. Not only will I be able to help animals that have been abused, I want to be able to provide treatment for any animals that are sick or injured when their owner is unable to help them.</p>
<p>As I got older, I began looking into ways I could get experience working with animals. One way I did this was becoming a volunteer at an animal shelter near my house. Every day that I would go there, I would go to one of the cat rooms and begin cleaning cages, making sure they had food, and giving them love. After a little while I would leave to go walk dogs and then return to each of the four other cat rooms to clean and play with those animals. One day while I was cleaning cages for some of the kittens, I noticed that there was a sick kitten in the corner. Since this was common, I didn’t think much of it but I did constantly watch her and I made sure she was comfortable and had enough food. After a few minutes, she began to have a seizure. Luckily there was another volunteer there with my so she ran to get a vet while I did the only thing I could and watched her. This experience made it clear to me that I wanted to become a vet so I would be able to do something more than just watch an animal and wait for someone else to come help it.</p>
<p>Even though the ASPCA commercials break my heart, growing up watching them has made me want to become a vet to help the animals and make a difference to the animals lives. Reaching my goal of becoming a vet is going to take a lot of hard work; four years of undergrad schooling plus another four of veterinary schooling. Here at Michigan State the competition is even bigger because it happens to be one of the top ten vet schools in the nation, but finding a career that I love and being able to work with animals is going to be worth it in the end. While I will not be able to help every single struggling animal, I will be able to help some and that is a start. It may be hard to watch for the two minutes they air, but the animals abuse commercials have lead me to thinking about pursuing a career in veterinary medicine and help make a difference to the animals I come across.</p>
