			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>In the music video for “Same Love,” there is a boy who goes through his teenage years trying to hide the fact that he is gay because he is too afraid of what his friends and what society is going to say to him. Macklemore says, “If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me. Have you read the YouTube comments lately? ‘Man, that's gay’ gets dropped on the daily. We become so numb to what we're saying.” Through this comment, it is shown that people don’t think before they say something. If the statement “that’s so gay” doesn’t effect them; they don’t realize that it may hurt someone else. Looking at comments on public sights and seeing “that’s so gay” written regarding something that is not liked, promotes a negative view on the mater. Technology is a major part of everyday life and when there are constantly comments and videos promoting hatred for homosexuality, society is going to follow suit. Eventually, he finds someone who he falls in love with. Unfortunately, even his own family isn’t accepting of their son’s homosexuality at first and this is shown through his parent’s reactions when they have dinner with him and his partner. Society is not accepting of the relationship either, and that is proven through the actions of a straight couple walking down the street along with the boy and his partner when they bump into him and make a comment. The music video shows the struggles that a gay man or woman goes through in everyday society. It shows how someone is afraid to be himself or herself because of the abuse, both physically and emotionally, that can occur just because they have different likes. The video also shows that no matter whom someone falls in love with, they love him or her no matter what. In the video, one of the partners was sick in the hospital and the other one sat by his side through it all. The video allows people to see that the couple cares about each other and it shouldn’t matter whether they are gay or straight. </p>
