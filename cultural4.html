			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Targeting sexual minorities is the most widespread and social acceptable hate crime in today’s society (“Background”). It is seen in high schools, online, and in various other places throughout society. Like Macklemore said in his song, “That’s so gay” has become a popular saying when referring to something that is not liked by a person. Personally, I have seen man people get into an argument online and the most popular “comeback” is “well, you’re gay,” whether or not the victim is actually gay. Calling someone or something gay has gone from meaning happy in previous decades to being paired with a negative connotation towards homosexual couples. So far in the United States, fourteen states have legalized gay marriage (14 States, 2013). Even though in those states the marriage is legal, the couple does not receive the same benefits from the government that a heterosexual married couple would receive since the marriage is not actually recognized by the federal government. Some differences between a gay married couple and a straight married couple are the costs, amount of paperwork, legal issues, and an increase on divorce costs if that were to occur. Gay married couples are not allowed to file for a joint tax return like straight couples have the option of doing. Instead, they must split their earnings evenly on individual tax returns, which will increase the money they are paying the government by about $6,000 (Gay Couples, 2012). Along with the inability to have joint tax returns, gay couples are ineligible for widow benefits and they are denied the right to make medical or financial decisions for their partner unlike a straight couple would be able to do (Gay Couples Rights, 2012).</p> 

<p>Vice President Joe Biden stated that gay marriage is the “Civil Rights issue of our day” (Alman, 2013).  Previous civil rights issues in America have included topics such as slavery, feminism, and religion. The majority of civil rights issues have lead to big transformations in America’s history and by grouping gay marriage with those previous issues shows its severity and impact in today’s society. Suicides because of gay individuals have the highest rates of suicides and it is rising (Suicide, 2013). The rates of suicide are generally higher in men than women. On average, 3,600 men and 1,200 women commit suicide each year and of those people, lesbian woman is six times more likely to attempt suicide while a gay man is thirty times more likely to attempt than the typical individual (Suicide, 2013). Besides suicides, the hatred towards homosexual individuals has lead to an increased about of mental health issues (Collingwood, 2011). </p>
